🖼️✨ Just wrapped up this Image Filter App using Python and OpenCV — and I couldn’t be more excited!  

🎨 **Features include:**  
🔹 Grayscale, Blur, Edge Detection, Sharpen & Pencil Sketch filters  
🔹 Brightness and Contrast adjustments  
🔹 Load, Save, Resize, Undo, and Reset image options  
🔹 A clean and modern UI built for smooth user experience  

This project was a perfect blend of creativity and technical skills — and seeing it come to life in VS Code feels amazing! 💻🔥  

Next up: Adding more filters and advanced image transformations! 🚀  

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! 💬
